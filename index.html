    <h3>Drawing and Painting: Contemporary Approaches</h3>
    <p class= "tag">with <span>Bogdan Luca</span></p>
    
    <p>This course explores contemporary approaches to drawing and painting. Emphasis will be placed on the development of independent themes and ideas, irrespective of the studentâ€™s skill level: those with some experience in painting or students at a more advanced level are welcome. Working from still life, photographic images and/or independent themes and ideas, students will be introduced to specific drawing and painting fundamentals and techniques through the use of custom tools and materials, with a view to developing a basis for a unique formal language.</p>
