    <h3>Master Class in Portraiture</h3>
    <p class= "tag">with <span>John Viljoen</span></p>
    
    <p>This structured curriculum responds to the increasing desire of serious artists to acquire the skills to be able to paint the portrait from life. Precise consideration will be given to accurate drawing and the effects of light on form. Working on a single piece throughout the term, you will cultivate an ability to challenge yourself, problem-solve and self-correct. Instruction will be in the form of intensive, daily demonstrations and individual critique. Using traditional ideas and techniques, you will create a personal expression through technical excellence. The only prerequisites are self-motivation, a passion to learn, and desire to be pushed to very high levels. You will perceive more deeply, think more clearly, and create more skillfully with your own hands, in this field where skills count! This is an ARC approved Atelier course. </p>
